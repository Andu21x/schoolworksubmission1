Might have to manually add the mysql-connector-j file, it is in the lib folder

Go to File -> Project Structure -> Libraries -> Click the '+' sign -> Java -> Find the mysql-connector-j-8.2.0 folder, click on it then -> Ok -> Ok

SQL Data can be modified or dropped using the in-IDE menu, the one on the right. It comes with Cloud Code
